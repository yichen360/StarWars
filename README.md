# StarWars

The data in this database has been pulled from https://swapi.dev/.
In Python, pull data on all available starships from the API.
The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship.
Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into your own collection.
Use functions at the very least!
